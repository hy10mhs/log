I liked playing video games when I was little.
I am an only child so I used to play alone.
When I was in elementary school, I made some friends.
They came to my house to play games together.

When I was five, my parents wanted to have a baby boy.
They were hopeful, but it was a girl again.
I was excited to have a sister.
My sister and I are best friends now.

I have two brothers and two sisters.
It is always crowded in my house.
We used to fight all the time when we were little.
But I like having many siblings now.
It's fun to spend time together with them.

I have an older sister.
When I was a kid, I wore my sister's hand-me-downs all the time.
As I grew up, I became taller than my sister.
It felt good to wear new clothes.

I have a big family with many cousins.
On holidays, we all gather at my house.
Last Christmas, we had dinner together.
After dinner, we went bowling.
It was fun.
We had a wonderful time.

My father passed away when I was young.
Since then, I have been the breadwinner in my family.
I had a part-time job after school, and I had two part-time jobs during the weekends.
I felt exhausted every day.

02

My brother is always in his room playing computer games.
He eats and sleeps in his room.
So I barely see him in the house.
He is totally addicted to computer games.

Playing games helps me release stress.
When I am overwhelmed by life and have too many things to think about,
I just play games for a few minutes.
It helps me forget things and I feel better after playing games.

Yesterday, I bought a new computer games.
It's called "The Hunter."
I started to play it and couldn't stop.
I ended up staying up all night playing the game.

I used to spend a lot of money on games.
New games kept coming out and I just had to buy all of them.
However, I can't afford to buy all the games that I want to play anymore.
I only play free online games now.

When I play online games, it is very easy to spend money on in-game items.
For example, I really wanted to have this nice sword and a suit for my game character,
so I spent 30,000 won in just one minute.

My friend and I are into this new game called "Candy Crush."
We played it at Starbucks today.
It was really fun playing with my friend and I even won a lunch on a bet.
I felt great.

03

I went on a new roller coaster in the amusement park.
It was so scary.
It was the most hair-raising roller coaster I have ever gone on.
I felt sick and exhausted after the ride.

When I am down, I go to an amusement park.
I go on every ride because it makes me feel better.
It is so much fun.
I normally buy a daily ticket because it is cheaper.

It was very crowded in the amusement park.
I waited in line for an hour to go on a single ride.
The ride was 30 seconds long.
It was so frustrating to wait in such a long line.

I prefer watching parades to going on rides.
The amusement park is close to my house.
It takes 30 minutes by bus.
Sometimes I go there only to watch the parades.
They make me laugh.

I love anything fast with drops and twists.
I can't do anything that spins round and round because it is boring and sometimes it makes me feel sick.
So I never go on merry-go-rounds.

I don't like haunted houses because I don't want people in masks touching me.
However, my little brother loves to be scared.
He tortures himself with horror movies all the time.

04

I was on a healthy diet for 5 days and I have been limiting myself.
But then I binge ate yesterday.
I ate a slice of cake, 3 scoops of ice cream and 5 pieces of chocolate after dinner.

I wanted to lose weight.
However, I didn't want to exercise.
I decided not to eat.
I lost weight by skipping meals.
I didn't eat anything.
I felt stressed because I was too hungry.

I didn't eat for a week.
I lost weight but a week later, when I started to eat again, I gained even more weight.
It's called the yo-yo effect.
I decided to go to the gym to exercise.
I lost weight and never gained it back.

I lost 5 kg through eating onions.
I ate an onion before dinner and I only had small portions of food.
Sometimes I just skipped dinner.
It was hard to eat onions but it worked.
I also exercised three times a week.

My friend lost 10 kg in a month.
She said she ate small portions of food.
She also exercised regularly.
I tried to go to the gym after work.
It was hard.
I just went to the park to take a walk.

I decided to go on a diet, so I went jogging every day.
I went to the park in the neighborhood to jog.
However, I couldn't give up eating late at night.
I had late night snacks quite often.
I failed to lose weight.

05

I read two to three books a month.
It takes time to read a book.
I like reading because I can forget things.
I also think I become more imaginative from reading books.

I like reading books.
It calms me down.
When I read, I underline the important passages.
It is helpful to read.
I sometimes write down some notes on the book when I think it is important.

When I finish a book, I always write a book report on it.
It helps to organize my thoughts.
Last weekend, I read an interesting novel.
After that, I spent two hours writing a book report on it.

I like to keep my books clean.
I try to take good care of the books.
When I read, I never write on or fold the pages.
So I don't like lending my books to friends.
It bothers me when my friend returns the book with folded pages.

I used to read a lot.
Recently, I have been reading less than before.
I try to read more because when I read a book, great ideas come to me.
I prefer reading to watching TV when I need to think.

I read books to get some information.
However, sometimes, it is hard to understand some books.
When I read a difficult book, I need to re-read the same sentences over and over to completely understand the paragraph.

06

It is safe to live in my neighborhood.
There are many surveillance cameras in the area.
So I feel safe to get around late at night.
However, my mom always yells at me when I come home late.
I want to live alone.

There is a bus stop in front of my house.
The subway station is just a few blocks away from my house.
So it is convenient to use public transportation.
I always travel by public transportation.

I live in an apartment but I don't get along with my neighbors.
I actually don't even know who lives next door.
But I think it is important to get to know your neighbors.

I usually come home late at night.
However, there has been lots of theft in the neighborhood.
So recently, I try to go home early in the evening.
But it is scary to be home alone.
So when no one is home, I go out to meet my friends.

I am very close to some of my neighbors.
We see each other almost every day.
I think they are closer to me than my siblings are.
I like spending time with my neighbors.

There are not enough parking spaces in my neighborhood.
It is difficult to find a spot when you try to park late at night.
It is frustrating.
Some neighbors often argue over parking.

07

I like scrubbing my body at the public bath.
I went to the public bath yesterday.
I first went into a hot tub and sat for 30 minutes and then started scrubbing.
After scrubbing for 20 minutes, I felt like I had lost 1 kg.

The first time I went to a public bath, I left my locker key somewhere
and I had to wait for the owner to find the space key to my locker.
Since then, I always wear a locker key around my wrist while bathing.

I went to the public bath with my friend for the first time.
He asked me to scrub his back.
After scrubbing his back, he washed my back.
By washing each other's back, I felt like we became closer to each other.

I am on a diet.
I weighted 50 kg a week ago.
I checked my weight again in the public bath yesterday,
and I stiil weighted 50 kg.
I took all my clothes off and put them in a locker.
I weighted myself again.
I weighted 49 kg.
I felt better.

When I go into a hot sauna, the first thing I do is to turn an hourglass over.
I just wanted to stay in for 5 minutes but it was a 10 minute hourglass.
So when half of it ran out, I turned it over and left the sauna.

I used to scrub my body myself.
My mom always asks the person who works there to scrub her.
I couldn't understand at first, but as I got older, I understood her and recently I started to ask the person to scrub me.
She is so good at it.
I usually pay her 20,000 won for scrubbing and a brief massage.

08

I thought there still was the last bus so I waited for it for more than half an hour.
It turned out that the last bus had left 5 minutes before I came.

I was sitting on the bus.
An old lady got on and stood next to the person in front of me.
I thought he would stand up but he didn't.
I felt bad and gave up my seat to the old lady.

I was waiting at the bus stop in the morning.
A packed bus came.
I normally don't get on thoes, but I was already late for work, so I just got on.
I ended up stading through the whole ride.
It was very tiring.

I always try to scan my transit card when getting off the bus because that way, I can get a free transfer to another bus or subway.
If I am not going to transfer, I just get off without scanning the card.

There were so many people near the front door that I went to the back door and got on.
The bus driver told me off.
He said that it was dangerous to get on from the back door.
I had no choice.

I almost fell when the bus made a sudden stop because I wasn't holding onto a strap.
It was embarrassing because everyone looked at me.
I took out my cell phone and pretended to make a call to my friend.

09

I always retouch my pictures with Photoshop before I post them on Facebook.
The pictures look much better with Photoshop.
I think Photoshop is the greatest thing ever.

I used to use a Polaroid camera a lot but it was such a bummer to buy instant film.
Now I can take pictures with my cell phone and print them out.
It is very convenient.

I saw my favorite actor at the restaurant.
I wanted to get an autograph but I thought it was rude to ask him while he was eating.
I decided to take a picture of him secretly.
My friend said that was ruder than asking him for an autograph.

I accidently deleted all the pictures on my cell phone.
I almost cried but realized that I had backed up my phone a week ago.
I couldn't be more proud of myself.

I went to my favorite singer's concert.
I took a lot of pictures of her but most of them were all blurry.
I am such a bad photographer.

My friend looks so pretty in pictures.
She is so photogenic.
On the other hand, I'm not very photogenic.
It is sad.
However, I don't think she is prettier than me at all.
She is just photogenic.

10

I like going to the bookstore.
It is fun looking around the bookstore.
When I have time, I just go there and pick up some books even though there is nothing in particular I want to buy.

The book I was looking for was not in stock at the bookstore I went to.
So I called another bookstore to see if they have a copy.
They did, so I went there and got it.

I had a list of books that I needed.
I went to the bookstore with the list and got all excited.
I ended up buying more books than I needed.

When I go to the bookstore, I first go straight to the best seller section.
There are shelves for best sellers only.
It is always fun to see the books on the shelves.

I once got a new book at the bookstore but it was damaged.
I had to go back to the bookstore the next day.
Since then, I always check before buying a book.

There are kiosks for searching for books at the bookstore.
It is convenient to use them because I don't have to chase bookstore staff to ask for help.

I was having a hard time looking for a book.
I looked it up on the kiosk, but it said the book was out of stock.
I really needed the book so I asked the bookstore staff for help and he helped me to locate it.
He was so nice.

11

I don't like going shopping with my girlfriend.
When we go shopping, it takes forever.
She usually spends five hours on shopping.
She tries on everything.
It makes me feel stressed.

I like trying samples at a food market.
I usullay go grocery shopping when I am hungry.
Yesterday, I went to the grocery store and tried too many samples as always.
I was too full to have dinner afterwards.

When I go grocery shoping, I usually check the expiration dates before buying anything.
It only takes 2 seconds to check.
Then, I don't have to worry about throwing away food.

I walked into a store and the sales clerk asked if I needed any help.
I said no and walked around.
She followed me.
It was annoying.
I couldn't stand it and walked out of the store.

If I am not happy with my purchase, I can return it.
However, I must have the receipt.
I tried to return an item without a receipt.
But I could only exchange it for another item.

It is nice to shop at the street stores.
I can get a cash discount.
So I always pay in cash when street shopping.
I like getting a discount.
I don't want to spend much money on shopping.

I like to watch YouTube video clips through my phone.
I used too much data for the Internet on my phone and I ended up receiving an enormous billing statement this month.

I lost my phone on the subway.
I went to the lost and found but couldn't find it.
I went to buy a new phone but since I didn't have the old one, I couldn't transfer all my contact numbers.

I left my phone in a cab.
I called my phone and the driver picked it up.
He came to where I was with the meter on.
I gave him the cab fare plus 30,000 won for finding it.

I often send text messages to my friends.
It is easy to use and more importantly, it is free to use.
I am so used to it that I rarely make calls.
It even feels awkward to talk on the phone.

I do so many things with my phone.
I listen to music and play games on my phone.
So I always carry a charger around because I use my smartphone very often and the battery dies so quickly.

My phone rang in the middle of the class.
I turned it off right away but the professor asked whose phone it was.
I stood up and I was so embarassed.
Since then, I always turn my phone off during class.

13

I don't like eating alone.
When I have no on to eat with, I just skip it and have some bread instead.
When I was taking classes by myself, I lost 5 kg in one semester.

I was at lunch and one of the people at my table was eating with his mouth open.
His noisy eating bothered me.
Furthermore, while he was talking, some food spattered onto mine.
I couldn't eat anymore.

I used to make side dishes myself.
However, I don't have time to cook anymore.
So I just buy some at the grocery store on my way home from work.
They taste pretty good.

When I was young, I was bad at using chopsticks.
My mom gave me a fork to use instead but my dad always told me that I should be able to use chopsticks well.
I tried hard and now I am pretty good at using them.

I was having lunch with my professor and class mates the other day.
I didn't get enough sleep the night before, so I was tired.
I stretched, but then the professor said it was rude to stretch in front of the table.
I didn't know.
I was embarassed.

My dad comes home from work at 7.
He eats dinner right away and then watches TV.
His habit is eating snacks at 10 p.m.
He always eays snacks with beer and he has gained 5 kg in a month.
I think he should go out and exercise instead of eating snacks at night.

14

My friend and I were planning to have dinner together
but we couldn't make any plans because it was hard to set a time that works for both of us.
I think she is too busy.

I didn't feel good all day.
I think the pork I had last night had gone bad.
It was seasoned with sauce so I couldn't really tell.
I had to cancel on my friend and go home and rest.
I felt bad.

I have accidently double booked myself for Friday dinner.
I don't want to let any of my friends down.
I really don't know what to do.

I like to be on time, but my friend Kim is always late.
It is annoying.
So I told her to meet me at 7 p.m. today and I showed up at 7:30.
It worked.
She showed up at 7:20.
I will always do this from now on.

I always write down plans that I made because I easily forget things.
I started to use the memo function on my smartphone and it is very convenient.
I can also set an alarm for my plans.

I totally forgot about the dinner with my friend.
My phone was dead and I stood her up, although I didn't mean to.
I felt so sorry for her.
I called her after I got home and she sounded really mad.
I am scared.

15

I receive too many spam mails from loaning services and adult websites.
It is so annoying.
I once accidently deleted an important email from my boss because I thought it was spam.

My boss told me to send him the itinery for our business trip.
I emailed him without attaching the itinery file.
I got yelled at and had to send it again.
I felt so stupid.

My friend asked me to send her the Power Point slides that I used for my presentation.
It took so long to attach this large file.
I think it almost took 30 minutes.

I have two different accounts from two different websites.
One is Gmail and the other one is Hotmail.
My Gmail account is for everything including getting coupons and announcements for events.
I use the Hotmail account to keep in touch with my friends.

I had a job interview yesterday and they told me to check my email today to see the result.
I forgot my ID and password, so I can't check my email now.
I feel so stupid.
I don't know what to do.

I wrote a long email to my old friend.
We haven't talked for almost 10 years so I had so much to tell her.
The email was about 3 pages long but suddenly the power went out.
I literally freaked.
When I turned my computer back on, it was all gone.

16

I was wating in line to get on the subway.
Me and other people were waiting behind the white line on the platform.
When the subway arrived, a man rushed and tried to get on the train before the passengers on the train got off.
He was so rude.

When I went to visit my friend, I first took subway line 2 but I had to transfer to line 3.
I went to the transfer station which was about 5 stops away and transfered to subway line 3.
It was easy.

On the first day of work, I remember being so nervous.
I took the subway but I got on the one going in the opposite direction.
I realized it about three stops later and I ended up being late.

I left my bag in the subway this morning.
I had two bags and I realized that I had left one of them.
I called the lost and found right away but they didn't have it yet.
When I called them again, they had it and I went there to get it.

I stayed up so late last night.
I was very tired on my way to school.
I was dozing off on the subway and I ended up missing my stop.
I woke up three stops later and was so late for school.

This morning, I got on a packed train.
I usually take the bus to work but I woke up late today so I had to take the subway.
There were so many people on the train that I couldn't get off at my stop.
I was so upset.

17

When I go to McDonald's, I always order a combo meal.
When I get a cheese burger only, it costs 3,500 won.
However, if I order a combo meal, it costs 5,000 won for a cheese burger, a coke, and French fries.

When I order my food, the staff repeats it into the microphone so that the kitchen staff can hear the order.
I remember that when I was young, it was interesting to see and I wanted to try it.

My friend and I went to Burger King.
We only had 6,000 won so we ordered two burgers and one coke.
They give free soft drink refills so we decided to share one coke.

Wendy's have their lunch menu from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m.
They offer the lunch menu at 50% off.
I went there for lunch yesterday but it was 5 minute past 2.
They said the lunch menu was not available at that time.
I was very disappointed.

When I don't feel like cooking, I just go out to the fast food restaurant in front of my house.
I pick up some food there, come home and eat.
The good thing about eating fast food at home is that it is easy to clean up.
I can just put the trash in a bag and throw it away.

When I went to McDonald's with my friend the other day,
I was on a diet so we ordered one Big Mac.
We cut it into four pieces and I was only going to eat one piece.
It was so good that we ended up eating two pieces each and finished the burger.

18

I love biking and I wanted to share information on different bicycles with other bikers.
I looked up online to find a bike club but couldn't find one.
I have good computer skills so I decided to make an online bike club and become the manager of it.

I once joined this online discussion club.
Members discussed any kind of topic and it seemed interesting.
When I joined the discussion for the first time, I was surprised to see how people could get so aggressive.
I felt very uncomfortable and decided to drop out of the club.

I recently joined this online book club.
We read a book once a week and share our feelings and thoughts about it.
It is so much fun.
I posted some questions about this week's book and 10 members responded.

My brother joined an online soccer community.
He told me that more than one hundred thousand members have joined this community.
They put up new information about their favorite teams and players and share video clips with other members.

There is a brand new ESL academy that just opened near Gangnam station.
They are holding an event to offer a discount when signing up for class.
If you join their online community and bring one friend to sign up for class, they give you a 10% discount on your tuition fee.

I heard about this discount event that a brand new ESL academy is having.
I decided to join the online community to get a discount.
When I tried to sign up, there were so many steps to follow and it was confusing.
I tried it twice and then gave up.

When I first joined the online book club, I could only see 3 category posts out of 10.
In order to see the rest of them, my member status needed to be upgraded.
I had to write 10 posts to be upgraded.

There was a member of the online discussion club who constantly raised his voice during the discussion.
He not only had strong opinions, but when some people didn't agree with his opinion he even cursed at those people.
The club manager ended up kicking him out of the club.

19

I like looking around at convenience stores.
They mainly sell snacks, beverages, toiletries, stationeries and instant food.
I hardly buy toiletries and stationeries there because they are more expensive than ordinary stores.

It is not safe to drink the tap water in my area.
So my mom always tells me to boil the tap water first and then drink it.
I used to boil it, but I recently started to drink bottled water.
I just buy them from the convenience store on my way back home.
My mom is thinking of getting a water purifier at home.

Convenience stores usually charge higher prices than ordinary grocery stores or supermarkets.
I guess it is the opportunity cost of convenience.
There is a big grocery store right in front of my house, so I rarely go to a convenience store.

Convenience stores have recently started a courier service.
They charge you 5,000 won per package.
I haven't used the service yet, but my friend said it was cheaper and more convenient than a regular post office service.

There are way too many convenience stores in the city.
You can find one on almost every corner.
It is certainly convenient that there are many of them on the street,
but we only have one bookstore in my neighborhood.
I think that is a problem.

Convenience stores usually have an ATM machine.
I almost never use the ATM in the convenience store
because they charge you a 1,000 won fee when withdrawing money, which is insane.
I always make sure I carry enough cash with me.

When the weather is nice outside,
I usually go to a convenience store in fron of my house and have some beers there.
They have a few tables outside the store,
so I usually sit there and have beers and snacks with my friends.

I live alone.
I don't like to cook for just myself so I usually go to a convenience store on my way back home.
I often buy Korean rice balls and instant cup noodles.
They might not be good for my health but they certainly taste good.

20

I am allergic to pollen.
I have a runny nose and itchy eyes in the spring.
It bothers me so much.
Yesterday, I was doing a presentation in class and my nose was running like water.
I was so embarrassed.
I can't stand spring.

I sweat a lot in summer and I suffer from heat rash.
i don't like it because it makes my skin itchy.
It's frustrating.
My friends used to make fun of me when I was young.
I prefer winter to summer.

When I was in the army, I had to shovel up the snow in winter.
It worried me whenever it started to snow.
I remember one time I shoveled up the snow all day long.
I was exhausted.

I feel the cold more than others.
I hated wearing a school uniform in the winter
because it is hard to keep warm and look cool at the same time.
Someone told me I needed to exercise regularly.
Since then, I work out at the gym every morning.

My favorite season is fall because I like enjoying the fall leaves.
There is a small mountain behind my house.
I often go to the mountain with my friends or family and look at the beautiful leaves in the fall.
I haven't been to the mountain this year yet so I am planning on going next week.

Spring and fall are tending to get shorter.
Yesterday, the weather was beautiful.
It finally felt like winter was over and spring has arrived.
However, today, it is 86 degree outside.
It feels like there are only summer and winter.

Summer has a longer daytime than winter,
but recently it feels like the summer daytime has been much longer than before.
I like it because I enjoy outdoor activities.
For example, I play soccer every other day.
On the weekends, I play baseball after breakfast.
I feel good after playing sports.

I hate mosquitoes.
I get easily bitten by them.
I couldn't sleep last night because of mosquitoes.
I was stressed.
I got out of bed and watched TV until 3 in the morning.
I am so tired today.

My skin gets very dry in winter.
Even though I don't have much time in the morning,
I never forget to put lotion on my body.
However, I slept in today, and I literally had no time to put lotion on my face.
I had to bring the lotion with me and apply it on the bus.
It was a bit embarrassing but I had no choice.

21

I usually take a walk at the park on the weekends.
It refreshes my mind and body.
I love having a cup of coffee at the park after dinner.
I think it is my favorite time of the day.

I jog in the park every morning.
After jogging, I get very thirsty, but I never drink from water fountains.
I worry about getting sick from the water.
So I just wait until I get home.

A week ago, I went to the park with my family.
We sat on the grass with a mat.
We listened to music on my phone.
My mom read and my dad slept.
We had a wonderful time there.

I went to the park after lunch.
I sat on a bench with a cup of coffee.
It was relaxing.
I spent about a hour there and went back home.
When I was little, I liked playing at the park.
I used to spend four or five hours a day at the park.
I feel comfortable when I'm there.

I went to to park yesterday.
It was relaxing to sit on a bench.
I had some crackers with me so I decided to feed some birds.
After feeding some birds for two minutes, a flock of them came to where I was.
They make me feel nervous.
I left the park.

I like riding a bike at the park.
Last weekend, I went to the park with my friend.
We rented two bicycles and rode them for a few hours.
It was enjoyable.
After riding the bikes, we sat on a bench and got rest.
We also had a great conversation.
I like going to the park with my friend.

I go to the park twice a week.
Yesterday, I saw a child who was lost there.
He was crying in front of a tree.
I took him to the main office.
They made an announcement to help locate his mom.
His mom showed up 5 minutes after the announcement.
It was meaningful to help the little boy.

There is a big park in my neighborhood.
It is a 10 minute walk from my house.
In ther park, you can see a garden, some statues, and even a small pond.
The park is a nice place to spend time with my friends and family.
I go there pretty often.

There is a big playground at the park.
The playground ahd slides, swings and a jungle gym.
It is always crowded with little kids.
I used to play at the playground all the time.
It was my favorite place in my neighborhood.

22

It was supposed to be sunny today.
However, It rained in the middle of the day and I got wet.
It is frustrating when the weather forecast is wrong.
I will just have to carry around an umbrella in my bag all the time.

It rained last night.
It was too foggy this morning and it was hard to see.
I almost got in an accident twice.
I had a hard time driving to work.
I hate going to work in the foggy mornings.

It was really hot today.
I went to see a soccer game and sat outside for three hours.
I got sick from the heat and I felt so tired.
I had to leave in the middle of the game.

Yellow dust hit Korea a week ago, so I put a mask on when I go out.
My clothes get so dirty when I go outside.
My school is far from my house but I never take a cab.
However, because of the yellow dust, I took a cab this morning.
It was very expensive, so I am thinking of carpooling with my friends tomorrow.

Recently, there has been a wide temperature range during the day.
When I jog in the morning, it is cold.
But it is hot during the day.
Yesterday, when I was coming home from school, it was quite chilly.
I caught a cold.

The vinyl greenhouse at my grandma's collapsed because of hail.
I heard it is tough to rebuild a greenhouse and it takes a long time.
I think it is important to use strong materials to build a greenhouse.
I am going to my grandma's this weekend to help her rebuild it.

It snowed a lot last night.
The streets were covered in snow so people couldn't drive.
I was late for work this morning and it was frustrating to walk to the subway station.

Heavy rain flooded streets in my town during the weekend.
So I couldn't go to school today.
I talked on the phone with my friend for three hours and watched TV for another three hours.
It was relaxing.

When it is nice out, I feel enenrgized and am tempted to go outside.
However, when it is rainy and cloudy, I feel lazy and begin to get depressed.
I think weather affects people's moods.

I sing to release stress.
Last night, I went to a singing room with my friends.
One of my friends started to sing and he wouldn't stop.
It was not enjoyable.
I am never going to sing with him again.

A couple of weeks ago, I went to a singing room in my neighborhood.
The soundproof of facilities at the singing room were not good.
I could hear everything from the next room.
It was bothersome.

When I am depressed, I go to a singing room.
I like to sing loud there.
when I do it, I feel better.
I went to a singing room a week ago, and the next morning, my voice was gone.

When I am at a singing room, I get very excited.
When my friend sing, I dance and play the tambourine.
It is fun to shake it while dancing.
It makes everyone in the room laugh.

I went to a singing room with my friend.
She is not a good singer.
It was frustrating to hear her singing.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I just turned the song off.
I didn't even feel sorry for her.

I go to this singing room once a week.
Since I go there with the same group of friends quite often,
the owner gives me more time for free.
She gave us 30 minutes as a bonus last time we went.
It is fun to go to a singing room with my friends.

I came back from the restroom.
I got confused about the room number and went into the wrong room.
I was embarrassed.
I ended up calling my friend to find where our room was.

I was trying to sing but everyone was talking.
I thought they were rude.
I turned up the volume on the microphone.
Everyone had to listen to my song.
It was fun to sing in front of everyone.

I went to a singing room after dinner last night.
After singing more than 20 songs, we were running out of time.
So we paid extra and added another hour.

After finishing my friend's birthday dinner we all went to a singing room near the restaurant.
Everyone was having a lot of fun but I got so drunk and fell asleep in the singing room.

24

My grandma suffers from insomnia really badly.
She usually takes some sleeping pills to go to sleep.
I feel really bad because she is so old.
I just want her to be healthy and happy.

I always wake up during the night.
I wake up at least twice and it is hard to fall back to sleep.
I am thinking of taking sleeping pills.
I really want to sleep through the night.

I almost fell asleep during class because I only slept for four hours last night.
Actually, I played a computer game for 5 hours.
I am so tired now.
I need to go home as soon as possible.

I usually fall into a deep sleep.
So I always have hard time waking up once I fall asleep.
I need to set more than three alarms before going to bed.
This morning, all of the three alarms went off but I heard nothing and I was late for school.

I grind my teeth in my sleep.
I think it not only causes damage to my teeth but also disturbs my sleep.
I really want to stop this but I don't know how.
I'm thinking of going to a dentist.

I sleep with my brother and he snores during sleep.
It is so loud that I can't fall asleep.
I thought he needed to see a docter so I told him to do so.
He said he never snored and he would not go see a docter.
It is ridiculous.

When I was young, I used to talk in my sleep.
I don't remember what I said but my mom told me I always talked in my sleep.
As I grew up, I don't think I talk in my sleep anymore.

When I was a kid, I once wet the bed while sleeping.
I remember that I woke up in the morning and cried.
My mom said it was okay but I felt embarrassed.

I need to sleep alone because I am a light sleeper.
I easily wake up when someone else tosses and turns next to me in bed.
I don't think I cna get married because I can't share a bed with someone.

I usually get tired unless I get at least 10 hours of sleep.
My dad only sleeps for 5 hours a day.
I am pretty sure that I won't be able to function if I only get 5 hours of sleep.

25

I drink like a fish.
When I drink, I drink at least 3 bottles of soju.
Most of my friends all drink a lot.
So when three of us meet, we usually drink 10 bottles of soju between us.
The funny thing is that we see each other almost every day.

I drank a lot and blacked out last night.
I literally don't remember how I got home.
I just hope that I didn't do anything stupid.
I am going to quit drinking.

I have this bad habit that whenever I geet drunk, I pay for the drinks.
I always regret it in the morning, but my friends love me doing it.
They always make me get drunk.
They are bad.

Last night, I went to have a drink with my friends.
I skipped dinner and just drank soju.
After drinking about two bottles of soju, I felt sick and I ended up throwing up on the street.
I was embarrassed.

I can't stand mixed drinks because I get drunk easily.
It also gives me the worst hangover the next morning.
I once had soju with beer and it almost killed me.
I never mix drinks since then.

I get drunk easily when I drink Korean rice wine.
I don't know why but it just gets me drunk so easily.
I once drank a bottle of it and blacked out.
Since then, I try not to drink too much of it.

I don't take my car when I drink because I have to call someone to drive for me.
I don't want to spend my money on having somebody drive for me.
So I just leave my car at home.

Last Saturday, I went to my high school reunion.
My friends and I were so glad to see each other after all these years that we ended up drinking until the next morning.

I had a really bad hangover this morning from last night.
I met up with my friend that I drank with and went straight to a restaurant to relieve the hangover.
I felt much better after having some soup.

My face turns red even when I drink a little.
When I get red, everyone looks at me and asks if I am drunk though I am not drunk.
It is embarrassing so I don't like to drink.

26

The movie was so sad that I cried my eyes out.
My friend said I embarrassed him.
I can't believe he didn't cry.
I think he is cold-hearted.

I usually pick a movie that has great reviews.
Last weekend I went to see a movie which had good reviws, but it was very disappointing.
I will not pick movies by reviws anymore.

I went to see this French movie that won at Cannes.
I was very excited but I actually couldn't enjoy the movie because I was too busy reading the subtitles.
I don't even remember what the main actress looked like.

I don't get bored watching my favorite movies twice.
Actually, I download movies that I like and watch them over and over again.
I watched The Usual Suspects again last night.
I don't even remember how many times I watched that movie.

I really liked the soundtrack for the movie so I bought the CD right after the movie.
It turned out that one of my favorite musicians had produced the album.
I listen to it every day.

Spiderman 3 came out and I got so excited.
I went to the theater in my neighborhood.
But the screen was so small and they only had seats for 4D movies left.
I don't like 4D movies so I just went back home instead.

The movie was so touching that it reminded me of a girl who was my first love.
I couldn't stop thinking about her after watching it.

I went to see this zombie movie last night.
There were so many cruel scenes in that movie that I couldn't stand it.
I just felt the theater in the middle of it.
The movie had put me in a bad mood.

The person in front of me was so tall that I couldn't see the screen well.
It was very distracting.
I thought my friend was even taller than him so I asked him to switch seats with me.

My friend took me to see this documentary film.
I am not a fan of documentary films.
I only watch action movies.
The movie was so boring that I dozed off in the middle of it.

27

My family was eating at a restaurant.
I found a hair in my food.
It was gross.
I complained, and then they brought me a new dish.
I dind't pay for it.

I like this Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.
They have good food but I always have to wait for 30 minutes after I order.
So when I don't have enough time, I don't go there.

The restaurant next to my house is not fancy at all.
They don't have the best food either, but it is cheap and it comes out on hugh dish.
I can never finish it by myself.

I like going to this Japanese restaurant near the Gangnam area.
Their staff is so kind and they know how to treat customers.
I always feel good after eating there.
My dad always gives them a tip when he leaves the restaurant.
I think they deserve it.

When the staff got my order, I asked her for water.
She said water and side dishes are put in front of the kitchen and that we need to go get it ourselves.
At first it was fine, but it got annoying when I had to stand up during the meal.

The waiter took my order wrong and brought me the wrong dish.
I ordered seafood noodles but he brought me seafood rice instead.
I didn't feel like waiting again, so I just ate the rice.

I heard that the restaurant was very famous for making great pizza and pasta.
I went there with my friends and waited for half an hour.
However, the food was actually not that good.
It was so different from what I heard.

Whenever I go to a Chinese restaurant, it takes forever for me to decide what to eat.
I can't decide between noodles with Chinese sauce and seafood noodle soup.
I always ask my friend to order those two and we share it.

My dad is on a diet.
My mom told him to stop eating sweets, so he actually quit for there days now.
We went to this Korean barbeque restaurant this evening.
The thing is that they always give coffee to their diners after the meal.
The coffee they gave us had a lof of sugar in it, so my dad was not allowed to drink it.

28

My dad got me a badminton racquet for my 15th birthday gift.
I was very excited.
My dad taught me how to play badminton.
I still enjoy playing badminton.
I have been playing it for over 10 years.

I am addicted to exercise.
I get moody or angry when I miss my workout.
My right knee was injured from running last month.
However, I continue to exercise.
I can't rest to recover.

I love running.
I feel so refreshed when I kick up the cardio and sweat it out.
I also ran this morning and my running clothes got soaked in sweat.
I couldn't feel more refreshed.

I prefer playing sports with others to playing alone.
I love playing soccer and baseball.
It is more fun when I play sports with my friends.
It builds up teamwork and I get to have great experiences with my friends.

When I was a kid, I was a shy boy.
I also used to get sick often.
I didn't have many friends.
My mom signed me up for swimming class and I really liked it.
About a year later, I became healthy and I wasn't so shy anymore.

I don't have time to exercise.
I could go to the gym after work but I usually get exhausted and go straight home.
I decided to take the stairs instead of using the elevator.
I think taking the stairs burns calories.

One of the reasons I like jogging is because I don't need to wear sportswear.
I sometimes wear a jogging suit, but I don't have to.
I can jog if I am in comfortable clothes and shoes.
That's all I need.

When I was in middle school, I joined my school's baseball team.
The coach gave me the equipment list for baseball at my first practice.
There was so much to purchase and I knew it would cost a lot.
I couldn't buy them all so I just borrowed some from my friends.

There is a park in my neighborhood.
I go there to take a walk or ride a bike.
The park also has some exercise machines.
Whenever I go to the park, I see many old people using the machines.

My boss called me this morning.
He was in a minor accident on his way to work.
I asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine.
He also told me to prepare the meeting by myself.

I took the driver's license test for both automatic and stick shift cars.
I know how to drive both of them.
However, my first car was an automatic and I hardly got to drive stick shift cars.
Automatic cars are much easier to drive.

My family went to visit my grandma's house last Saturday.
I was so excited to see her but because of the terrible traffic I had to step on the accelerator for 4 straight hours.
I was exhausted when I got to my grandma's.

The driver in front of me was the worst driver ever.
I think he can't calculate the distance between his car and the car in front of him.
I had to keep stepping on and off the brake because of his poor driving skills.
It was tiring.

I forgot to turn on the blinker and made a right turn.
The car behind me thought I was going straight and he didn't reduce his speed.
He ended up hitting me from behind.
It was my fault.

I enjoy driving fast.
On my way to my grandma's house, I took a highway.
I was driving on a passing lane and the car in front of me was so slow.
I flashed my high beams to make the driver move, but he didn't notice.
I just overtook the car in the end.

Last night I was driving home from work.
The car in front of me kept changing lanes.
At first, I didn't take it seriously, but the car ended up hitting a tree.
The driver was driving drunk.

It suddenly started to rain so I turned on the windshield wipers but they were not working.
I couldn't see anything.
I knew something was wrong so I went straight to the car care center.

My younger sister wanted to get a driver's license.
She studied for two months and went to take the test.
It turned out that she passed the written test, the skill test, and the road-driving test, all on her first try.
I was so proud of her.

30

I don't like to wear a seatbelt in a car because it feels restricted.
However, I always wear a seatbelt when I drive on a highway.
I feel like I have to wear it regardless of my seating position.

When I tried to come out of the parking lot at the mall,
i didn't see the car passing behind me and almost hit it.
Since then, I always park backwards.
In that case, I won't be at a risk of reversing into unknown traffic.

I slept in today.
I didn't want to be late for work, so I rushed.
When I was cruising down the highway making record time on my commute,
a police car pulled me over on the side of the road.
I got a speeding ticket.

I just heard the news that one of my middle school friends got hiut by a drunk driver.
I couldn't believe it because he still lives in my neighborhood and I often see him on the street.
I decided not to drink and drive ever again.

I woke up late today.
I didn't want to be late so I rushed outside and hailed a cab.
The cab driver tried to go fastw and he got a ticket for running a red light.
Many people run red lights.
I had no luck this morning.

I decided to change lanes so I turned my left turning signal on and looked at my left mirror.
There was no car to my left so I changed lanes but the car behind me honked at me.
I freaked because I didn't see the car through my mirror.

I don't like driving in the dark because when I turned on the headlights, it is hard to see if a person is on the road.
On my way back home last night, it got dark so I turned on the headlights.
I had to pay careful attention and it was tiring.

My car would not start when I turned the key in my ignition.
Everything but the engine seemed to be functioning.
It seemed like my car battery was dead so I had to call my car insurance company.

I wanted to get bottled water from a convenience store.
The store didn't have a parking lot so I just pulled over right in front of the store.
When I pulled over and got out, the car behind me honked at me.
I had to get back into the car and drive away.

31

I don't like to waste my time at a bank, so I went to the bank at 9 a.m.
I was surprised to see some people who were already there.
I had to take a number and wait.

I once lost my wallet on the subway.
I had 100,000 won in cash at that time and I couldn't find my wallet at all.
Since then, I only carry debit cards in my wallet.
So I often use an ATM to withdraw some cash.

When I started my new job,
my boss told me to open a bank account at the ABC bank for payroll.
I had to change the bank account I used for payroll.

I went to the bank to wire some money to my mom.
The bank clerk told me that I haven't updated my bankbook for a while.
I asked her to do it but then it literally took 5 minutes to finish updating it.

I needed some cash so I looked for an ATM.
I don't like to withdraw cash through an ATM that's not my bank because they charge me a fee to use another banks' ATM.

My friend booked some concert tickets online.
I told her that I would wire her the money.
I didn't have enough time to go to the bank so I just used the ATM in my building to wire the money.

I forgot my debit card PIN nubmer and entered the wrong number three times.
I was not allowed to deposit or withdraw through the ATM machine.
I had to go to the bank and get a new PIN number.

I lost my debit card.
I called the bank right away and reported my debit card stolen.
I went to the bank the next day and got it reissued.
It was a bummer.

Last month, I got my first credit card.
I was thinking of getting a department store credit card but they had high annual fees.
So I just went to the local bank and had my first credit card issued there.

Since 2012, I have been saving up 100,000 won each month for a trip to Europe.
I am planning to withdraw my installment savings in 2014.
It is best not to close it before the account has matured.

32

I got a bike for my 18th birthday present.
It was my first bike and I liked it a lot.
One day, I parked my bike near the subway station, and someone stole it.
I cried for a week.

I hate getting on a packed bus during rush hours.
So I decided to ride a bike to work.
I got a new bike and a helmet and was so ready for it.
However, the bike lanes were not built so well, so I gave up on riding it to work.

I was riding downhill at a high speed and almost got in a bike accident last weekend.
I squeezed the brakes quickly.
I avoided the accident, but fell over and got some cuts and bruises.

When I first learened how to ride a bike,
it was hard to keep my balance.
My dad held my bike from the back and I rode it for an hour.
After an hour, my dad would let the bike go without telling me.
I thought he was still holding it but he wasn't.
I felt really good.

When I was six years old, my dad got me a bike with training wheels.
I was so excited and rode the bike every day.
About three months later, my dad took the training wheels off.
At first it was not easy to keep balance, but soon, I got it and it was so much fun.

Recently, I bought a secondhand bike.
When I was going up a hill, I put the bike into 1st gear but the chain came off.
I stopped and put it back on.
I rod again a bit further up the hill but then it came off again.

I have to put so much effort in getting my road bike up hills that aren't even that steep.
I am an athletic person, so I am wondering if there is something wrong with my bicycle.

Last weekend, I went to the park to ride my bike.
There were many kids playing at the park.
One kid came out of nowhere and ran in front of me.
I tried to avoid him but then I fell off my bike.
I got some cuts and bruiese.

I have a bicycle with 10 gears.
When I ride it, I usually put it into a low gear when I start off.
I increase my rear gear as I speed up.
When I slow down or approach a hill, I put the gear down
and then when I ride at high speeds or downhill, I put the gear up again.

33

The weather was boiling hot and I was so thirsty.
I found a vending machine and tried to get a cold soda.
I put some coins in, but the vending machine ate my coins.
I was so upset and gave it a kick.
It spat out my coins.

My professor told me to get him a coke.
I went to the vending machine right outside the classroom.
However, it was out of coke.
I knew he would be upset if I didn't get him the drink, so I ran upstairs to get one.

I got a coffe from a vending machine.
When I tried to drink it, I saw something in my coffee and threw it away.
I wasn't sure what that was but it certainly felt disgusting.

I tried to buy coffee from a vending machine.
There was a red signal flashing next the coffee button but I didn't know what that meant.
So I put some coins in and pushed the button.
The vending machine made a little noise and then the coffee came out without a cup.
It was ridiculous.

I put in a thousand won bill and I was supposed to get 300 won in charge.
However, it did not give me the charge.
I was upset.
I could have called the customer service center but I knew it would take more than 10 minutes to solve this situation.
I decided not to call and gave up my 300 won.

I won a coffee on a bet so my friend took me to a vending machine to buy me a cup of coffee.
The vending machine even had cafe mocha, so I pushed the cafe mocha button.
When the coffee came out, I tried one sip it tasted really weird.
It didn't taste like coffee.
I just threw it away.

I usually drink three cups of coffee a day.
However, when I get stressed, I tend to drink more.
My boss yelled at me at work this morning for something that I didn't do.
I felt so stressed and I drank 10 cups of coffee from a vending machine throughout the day.
i won't be able to sleep tonight.

I am a fan of coffee from vending machines.
It is cheap and it tastes so good.
One day, I took my American friend to a vending machine and got him a milk coffee.
He loved it so much that now he drinks it every day.
He is addicted to it.

It was so hot outside and I was very thirsty.
I found a vending machine and I was so excited to get a cold drink.
However, I only had a 5,000 won bill but the vending machine only accepted up to 1,000 won bills.
I had to walk for another 30 minutes to find a store.

34

The gas price keeps on rising, so I always check the gas price per liter and look for the lowest one in my town.
Yesterday, however, the low gas signal came up so I just went to the nearest gas station.

I went to the gas station to put gas in my mom's car.
It was my first time to drive her car so I was nervous.
When the guy asked me to open the gas door,
it took me a while to find the button to pop it up.
I felt so embarassed.

I only pump gas at BB has station because I get a 5% discount by paying with an AA credit card.
I told my friends about this, and they all go to BB gas station now.

I put regular gas in my car, but my dad puts diesel fuel in his car.
I was driving around with my dad's car yesterday and was running out of gas.
I didn't know if it was enough to get home.
I have never put gas in the car before and I accidently put regular gas in my dad's car instead.

I just got my driver's license and drove my mom's car around.
I went to the gas station for the first time.
I didn't know which side of the car the tank was on, and I pulled up on the wrong side.
It was frustrating to switch sides at the busy gas station.

I was on my way to my grandma's and I was on a highway.
The low gas signal came up but I thought I had enough to get to her house.
About 30 minutes later, my car ran out of gas and stopped.
I had to run to the nearest gas station, buy gas, and put it in my car myself.

When my car needs cleaning, I face a straight choice between cost and effort.
I usually pick the auto car wash.
It costs 5,000 won for a regular wash which includes wheels and hubs and it dries the car.

Last month, my family went on a trip to the southern part of the country.
We took highways and stopped at the rest areas three times.
We also put gas in the car every time we were at the rest area because you never know when you would come across the next gas station.

It is hard to find LPG stations in the city.
I once got in a car accident and my insurance company lent me an LPG-fueled vehicle.
When the low gas signal came up, I had to go all the way to the eastern part of the city.

35

After my dad retired, he wanted to help my mom with the housework.
He tried to cook but it was so bad that we couldn't eat it at all.
My mom told him to do the dishes instead.
When my mom cooks, my dad does the dishes afterwards.

My mom went on a trip with her friends.
I wanted to impress her while she was gone.
I decided to clean both the living room and the bathroom.
It was not easy to clean the toilet but I felt good once I finished it.

The carpet didn't look dirty but techinally it was my turn to vacuum.
I didn't want to do it but I did it anyway.
After cleaning it, I realized how dirty it was.
I think I should do it on a regular basis.

It was my grandma's birthday.
We were having a great dinner at our house.
When my grandma tried to stand up to go to the bathroom, she spilled the soup in front of her on the floor.
I had to get up and mop the floor.

My mom decided to make steak and seafood pasta for my grandma's birthday.
She cooked for two hours and the house was filled with the smell of seafood.
I opened every window in the house and let the air out.

I don't like to throw away the food waste.
It smells so bad.
Last night I went out to throw it away and the smell got worse when I got to the trash bin for the food waste.
I threw it from a distance and ran.

We separate our trash at home.
However, when I wend to the States, I was surprised to see that not many people were using recycling bins.
I think it is important to separate trash.

The weather was really nice on Saturday.
I decided to do the laundry.
I put all the clothes in a washing machine.
It took an hour to wash them.
After that, I put all the clothes on the drying rack.
I felt good.

My mom tells me to wipe the table first and then put the spoons and chopsticks on.
I once forgot to wipe the table and saw my dad dropping his food on the table, grabbing it and putting it back in his mouth.
I felt bad and since then, I always wipe the table.

36

My friend Lee is a heavy smoker.
So whenever we go to a coffee shop, she always makes sure it has a smoking area inside.
She never goes to one without one.

I went to the coffee shop in front of my office this morning.
I ordered and waited but my buzzer never rang.
I waited for more than 10 minutes.
I went up to the counter and asked.
They appologized and gave me a free cookie.

Whenever I go to a coffee shop, I choose between an Americano, latte, and macchiato.
It depends on my mood.
Today, I felt down so I had a latte with extra caramel syrup.

I always drink coffee after lunch.
It is like a habit.
The thing is, the lunch that I usually eat costs 5,000 won and a Starbucks latte also costs 5,000 won.
So I am seriously thinking of quitting coffee.

My boss told me to get him a soy latte.
I ordered the soy latte to go and left the cafe.
When I gave it to my boss, he said it wasn't the soy latte.
They gave me the wrong drink.
I got yelled at and went back to get him a soy latte.

I went to a coffee shop with two other friends.
We were chatting for hours.
A few hours later, one of my friends called me so I told him to come to the coffee shop.
The table was not big enough so we had to put two tables together and sit.

I wanted to drink an Americano so I went to the local coffee shop in my area.
I only had 2,000 won and I ordered an iced Americano.
They said an iced Americano was 2,500 won.
I had to order a hot Americano and let it sit for 10 minutes.

There is a brand new coffee shop in front of my office.
it wasn't a big franchise shop like Starbucks so I thought their coffee would be cheap.
However, a cup of latte was over 4,000 won.
I was so disappointed.

I was at a coffee shop with my friend the other day.
We ordered our drinks and while my friend went to get our drinks, I tried to get some straws and some napkins.
I went up to the counter but couldn't find them.
Straws, syrup and napkins were placed all together next to a trash bin.

37

I left the offcie at midnight.
However, It was Friday so there were so many people on the street and everyone was trying to get cabs.
It took me 40 minutes to get a cab.

The weather was freezing cold and there were no cabs around.
I tried to call a cab but they said no cab was available at that moment.
I just walked home.

I could have walked home but it was too cold.
I caught a cab but since it was 2 in the morning,
I had to pay an extra charge.
I should just stay home when the weather is bad outside.

When I told the taxi driver my destination,
he refused to let me ride in his cab.
I was upset but did not say anything and got out.
I did it because recently there are so many crazy people that I don't want to make any trouble.

I was familiar with the route that I was heading to.
However, the cab driver took a longer way around.
He almost charged me double the usual fare.
It was unfair.

I woke up late this morning so I took a cab.
I thought that taking a cab would be faster than the bus because it doesn't make any stops.
However, the traffic was horrible during rush hours and it ended up taking longer than usual.

I don't usually take a deluxe taxi because they are too expensive.
However, when I take a cab at night,
I usually use deluxe cabs because they drive up to my house.

I got in a cab this morning.
I stayed up late last night so I was very tired.
However, the cab driver would not stop talking.
I didn't want to be rude but it was frustrating.

The weather was so hot that I decided to take a cab.
When I told the driver my destination,
he said he doesn't usually take passengers for short distance rides in the city.
I felt bad so I didn't take the change when getting off.

I went from Gangnam to Wonju in a speeding taxi.
It only took 40 minutes but I almost wet my pants.
I never want to get in a speeding taxi ever again.

I wanted to learn Chinese.
So I looked online and found a Chinese language academy near Gangnam station.
I signed up for a class by paying with my credit card.

The basic Chinese class I wanted to take was already so full that I couldn't sign up.
I called the academy and asked if there was another class still open.
But they said every class was full.

I take a Japanese class at 7 in the morning.
Since it is too early, there are not many people in the class and I like it.
It is hard to wake up so early but it is definitely worth it.

On the very first day of the class,
I went to the academy after work.
I went to the front desk on the second floor and received the books and my class identification card.
I put the card in my wallet in order not to lose it.

I signed up for TOEIC class.
My score before I signed up was 500 out of 990.
I needed to score at least 800 on TOEIC to apply for a job so I decided to study at an academy.
Three months later, I took the TOEIC test and my score went up to 810.
I was so happy.

When I sign up for class at a language academy,
I usually consider my friends' opinions, the academy itself and the instructors.
It is important for the academy to have a good reputation so I often look online to see the reviews.

I never study when I get home after class.
I asked some of my classmates if they could study together after class, and they all wanted to do it.
We always study together for an extra hour after class.
I think it really hepls.

I signed up for this Japanese class last month.
Because of some overtime and get-togethers from my department, I only took three classes out of ten.
It was a waste of money.

I have been going to a Chinese academy for six months now.
Even though I couldn't attend regularly, I constantly signed up and tried my best to go.
This month I was actually not absent a single day.
I am so proud of myself.

I started to go to the gym a month ago.
I walk on a treadmill and do weight lifting.
When I am working out, a trainer comes up to me and helps me do it in the right position.
It is very helpful to exercise right.

People change in a locker room.
I feel self-conscious in the locker room.
So I change as quickly ad possible, while not looking at anyone.

I usually bring my workout sneakers to the gym.
I once left my shoes in a locker room and I lost them.
I was so upset but it was my fault so there was no one to blame it on.

When I get to the gym, the first exercise I do is running on a treadmill for half an hour.
I first run and then stretch for another half an hour.
It feels really good when I sweat after running.
I don't do the bikes or steppers.

When I am at the gym, I first run for 30 minutes.
After running, I do weight lifting for an hour.
I heard that weight lifting is very important so I try to do it as often as possible.
It certainly is not fun but I feel good after doing it.

The gym membership costs 80,000 won per month.
But if you join for six months, They give you a discount and it is 300,000 won for six months.
But the discount is only offered when you pay it all at once.

My gym has many exercise machines and group exercise rooms for yoga and Pilates.
You can also practice golf in the basement.
I like doing group exercises like yoga so I look up the schedule and always go on time.

One of the best things about working at a gym is that I can work out in any weather condition.
I mean, if you like to jog in the park, you can't do it when it rains.
I go to the gym almost every day even when it rains or snows.

I have been going to the gym for three months now.
I have been working out at least three times a week.
I lost weight and gained muscle.
My friend decided to join the gym after she saw me.
I felt good.

I didn't go on a vacation this summer.
I took three days off and just stayed home.
I really needed this time.
I woke up at 11 a.m. and watched TV for 10 hours.
It was the best vacation ever.

I went to a mountain for a vacation.
The weather was so nice and it was just so refreshing.
I don't normally go hiking, so it was very hard to climb up to the top.
However, once I was on the top, it felt great.

My family went to the beach last weekend.
I love going to the beach because I love swimming.
My sister and I swam for 5 hours and we had a great barbeque in the evening.
It was delicious.

The last time we went on a vaction, we went to Busan.
The city is located in the very south of the country.
They have great seafood there.
I looked online and found some good tourist places.
We went to three different locations and they were all great.

My friend and I decided to go on a bike trip.
We biked toward the northern part of the country this summer.
We biked about 30 miles a day and stayed at a bed and breakfast at night.
It was one of the best trips in my life.

My family once went to the beach.
My mom made a hotel reservation a month in advance because it was the busy season.
When we got to the hotel, we could see that every room was booked already.

I am planning on going on a vacation to Thailand.
I have never been there before, so I am thinking of going through a tour package from a travel agency.
A local guide will explain everything and it would be safer than going alone.

I really needed a vacation.
I finally had one and went to Jeju Island for three days.
It was so relaxing.
I ate so much delicious food and slept for 10 hours a day.
After such a great vacation, I felt totally refreshed.

I usually go somewhere during my vaction because I don't want to waste my time sitting at home.
However, as I got older, I feel more exhausted once the vacation ends.
I am thinking of staying home from my next vacation.`
